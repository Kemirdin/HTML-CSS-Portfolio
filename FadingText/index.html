    <h1>Who I am ?</h1>

    <p>I graduated university but some reason I emigrated here ,My english or dutch is not so fluent.Finding a suitable job is quite difficult for me in the Netherlands, most of which require either fluent Dutch or fluent in any language other than English.I've so far failed to find a job.I've been working and working ,Bachelor's degree holders with low-income and Having chidren.I work full-time ,Going back to school at age 30 and also without supporting ,It doesn't make sense to me, that's why I've decided to self-taught online course. Since 6 months ago I dove head first into Full Stack Web Development.</p>
